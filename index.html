			<span class = "myintro">I am a candidate of Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working at <a class = "links" href = "https://www.cmu-biometrics.org/" target="_blank">Cylab Biometrics Center</a> with <a class = "links" href = "https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/savvides-marios.html" target = "_blank">Professor Marios Savvides</a> to research about artificial intelligence for large-scale retail service. I received my bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, where I worked on crowdsourcing and misinformation identification with <a class = "links" href = "http://croma.eecs.umich.edu/">Professor Walter Lasecki</a>. My research spans the intersection of human computer interaction, social computing, and AI.<br/><br/>I am applying Ph.D. programs for Fall 2021.

					<p>&#x2022 Collaborated with Bossa Nova Robotics to develop the detection algorithm that identifies all Walmart items on the shelf in real-time using various state-of-the-art deep learning techniques</p>
					<p>&#x2022 Implemented the web system for simulation of the real-time product detection that enables measuring the performance of detection algorithm and show users the detailed information of each identified items</p>

				<div class = "project-description">
					<p>&#x2022 Developed the data cleaning web application that enables crowd workers to filter out low-quality Walmart product training images after comparison with the target images.</p>
					<p>&#x2022 This application expedites the data cleaning process with fewer crowd workers, and eventually highly contributed the improvement of the performance of the Walmart product detection.</p>
