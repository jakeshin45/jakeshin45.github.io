I am currently working at <a class = "links" href = "https://www.cmu-biometrics.org/" target="_blank">Cylab Biometrics Center</a> with <a class = "links" href = "https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/savvides-marios.html" target = "_blank">Professor Marios Savvides</a> to research about artificial intelligence for large-scale retail service. I received my bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, where I worked on crowdsourcing and misinformation identification with <a class = "links" href = "http://croma.eecs.umich.edu/">Professor Walter Lasecki</a>. My research spans the intersection of human computer interaction, social computing, and AI.<br/><br/>I am applying Ph.D. programs for Fall 2021. Wish me a good luck!<br/><br/>Email: jeongkes[at]andrew.cmu.edu<br/><br/><a class = "links" href = "etc/cv.pdf" target = "_blank">[ CV ]</a></span>
