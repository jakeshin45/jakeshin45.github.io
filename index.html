	<p> I am a candidate of Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I am interested in research in <strong>deep learning</strong> and <strong>human-robot interaction</strong>. I am currently working at <a href = "https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/biometrics.html">CyLab Biometrics Center</a> with Professor <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msavvid/">Marios Savvides</a>. Also, I am working at <a href = "http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/">Human and Robot Partners (HARP) Lab</a> with Professor <a href = "http://hennyadmoni.com/">Henny Admoni</a>.</p>
	<p>In the past, I graudated University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E) degree in Computer Science. While I was at Michigan, I worked at Crowd and Machine (CroMa) Lab with Professor <a href = "https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/">Walter Lasecki</a>.</p>
	<p>I am expected to obtain the Master's degree at May 2021, and looking for the Ph.D program that I can continue the research in deep learning field.</p>
