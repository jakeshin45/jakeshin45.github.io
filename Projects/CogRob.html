	<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page is about my final project from 15-694: Cognitive Robotics course at Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department that I took in Spring 2020 semester. The main goal of the project is to give the Cozmo robot an ability to detect the partial cube in his vision by using a deep learning, then turn to its direction so that Cozmo can see the full cube in its vision.</p>

	<h3>2. Robot and Software</h3>
	<p>At this project, I have used the <a href = "https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html">Cozmo</a>. Details of 'How does the Cozmo work?' can be found at <a href = "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15494-s20/schedule.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Base code that operates the Cozmo for this project and this course can be found at <a href = "https://github.com/touretzkyds/cozmo-tools" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>For the training and testing the partial cube detection, I used the <a href = "https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>.</p>
