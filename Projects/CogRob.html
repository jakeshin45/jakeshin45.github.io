	<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page is about my final project from 15-694: Cognitive Robotics course at Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department that I took in Spring 2020 semester. The main goal of the project is to give the Cozmo robot an ability to detect the partial cube in his vision by using a deep learning, then turn to its direction so that Cozmo can see the full cube in its vision.</p>
